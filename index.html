    <p>My research focuses on the economics of education, behavioral economics, family economics, and health economics.

            This paper provides the first evidence that children's economic preferences vary systematically with parental mental health. Using experimentally elicited measures of economic preferences from more than 4,500 children in Bangladesh, we document that children with parents who are affected by mental illness are less prosocial but more patient than their peers with mentally healthy parents. Attitudes toward risk remain unchanged. We discuss potential pathways through which parental mental health may influence the formation of children's preferences, documenting that children with mentally ill parents assume greater responsibilities within the family, experience less parental involvement, and are exposed to a more adverse home environment.

            How do firms and workers adjust to trade and technology shocks? We analyze two mechanisms that have received little attention: training that upgrades skills and early retirement that shifts adjustment costs to public pension systems. We combine novel data on training participation and early retirement in German local labor markets with established measures of exposure to trade competition and robot adoption. Results indicate that negative trade shocks reduce training — particularly in manufacturing — while robot exposure increases training — particularly in indirectly affected services. Both shocks raise early retirement among manufacturing workers. Structural change thus induces both productivity-enhancing and productivity-reducing responses, challenging simple narratives of labor market adaptation and highlighting the scope for policy to promote adjustment mechanisms conducive to aggregate productivity.

            This paper investigates the causal effect of education on life satisfaction, exploring effect heterogeneity along employment status. We use exogenous variation in compulsory schooling requirements and the build-up of new, academically more demanding schools, shifting educational attainment along the entire distribution of schooling. Leveraging plant closures and longitudinal information, we also address the endogeneity of employment status. We find a positive effect of education on life satisfaction for employed individuals, but a negative one for those without a job. We propose an aspiration-augmented utility function as a unifying explanation for the asymmetric effect of education on life satisfaction.

            Progressive gender norms that conflict with traditional institutions are increasingly hypothesized as a key driver of declining fertility rates. This paper examines the long-run demographic effects of socialist schooling in the former German Democratic Republic, where advancing gender equality was a core educational objective. Leveraging school entry cutoffs in a difference-in-differences framework, I compare adjacent cohorts exposed to different durations of socialist instruction before reunification abruptly replaced it with more gender-traditional content amid rapid institutional transformation. I find that an additional year of exposure significantly reduces both actual fertility and desired family size. Consistent with a norm transmission mechanism, treated individuals express more egalitarian gender attitudes, and treated women exhibit higher labor force participation. Fertility effects are weaker in regions where childcare remained more accessible after reunification, suggesting that supportive institutions can buffer the influence of gender egalitarian norms on fertility choices.

            We use unique panel data on economic preferences of children and adolescents from 3,800 households in rural Bangladesh to comprehensively study preference formation before onset of adulthood. Previous evidence on the formation of children's preferences is mainly based on cross-sectional data which makes it difficult to study dynamic, within-individual development over time. With our panel, we provide comprehensive empirical evidence on the sources of heterogeneity in dynamic preference trajectories, building on the Cunha and Heckman-model of skill formation. We provide first evidence on self-productivity and cross-fertilization of preferences, and study the role of family members and of parental investments and exogenous shocks.

            This paper identifies adolescence as a formative period in the development of time preferences. Using data from 80,000 individuals in 76 countries, I exploit within-country, cross-cohort variation in exposure to natural and man-made disasters. Instability experienced between ages 13 and 17 persistently lowers adult patience, while instability shocks before or after this window have minimal effects. Evidence from German panel and migrant data indicate that shocks operate through psychological rather than material channels, reducing perceived future stability. The findings highlight adolescence as a critical window for shaping time preferences and suggest high returns to stability during this stage of development.
